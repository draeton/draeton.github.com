title: Javascript getIsType Method
---

This is a little script I wrote which uses currying to produce
a set of type checking methods. It was initially intended for a
small utility library I was writing, but it now seems better to me
for developers to devote their efforts to improving and maintaining
libraries with existent open-source communities.
