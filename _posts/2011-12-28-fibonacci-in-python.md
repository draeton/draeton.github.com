So, I decided to jump in and finally give Python a real try, and I have
to say that I'm enjoying many of the features, although I'm not entirely
sold on the syntax.

Given my love affair with JavaScript, there are a number of similarities
here: dynamic typing, type coercion, array and object literals, first-class
functions, and closures. It is a very comfortable transition.

In addition, you get a working class system with classical inheritance,
a nice package system, and some nimble standard modules.

Wait, what did I love about JavaScript again? :-P I'm really going to have
to explore this language in depth.

In the interim, I would appreciate some constructive criticism of this
Fibonacci script I put together in the last couple of days as a learning
exercise. Please leave comments at Github or below.
